Installation
============

You have a few options when it comes to installing Fluxxor. Keep in mind that, while Fluxxor works great with [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/), React is not required for Fluxxor.

CommonJS Module Bundlers
------------------------

Fluxxor is distributed [on npm](https://www.npmjs.org/package/fluxxor). You can install it with

`npm install [--save] fluxxor`

If you're using a client-side module bundler like [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) or [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/), you're done! Simply `require("fluxxor")` to get a reference to the library.

Browser Builds
--------------

Browser builds and corresponding source map files can be downloaded from [the Fluxxor releases page](https://github.com/BinaryMuse/fluxxor/releases) or installed via [Bower](http://bower.io/) via `bower install fluxxor`. Browser builds use a universal module definition, and should work in the following environments:

### CommonJS

```javascript
var Fluxxor = require("path/to/fluxxor");
```

### AMD

```javascript
define("someModule", ["Fluxxor"], function(Fluxxor) {
  // ...
});
```

### Standalone

```html
<script src="path/to/fluxxor.js"></script>
```

```javascript
window.Fluxxor.createStore({ ... });
```

Browser Compatibility
---------------------

Fluxxor is compatible with any [ES5-compliant browser](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (IE 9+, FF 4+, Safari 5.1.4+, Chrome 19+, Opera 12.10+). You can use [es5-shim](https://github.com/es-shims/es5-shim) for other browsers.
