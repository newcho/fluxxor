Installation
============

Fluxbox is distributed [on npm](https://www.npmjs.org/package/fluxbox). You can install it with

    npm install [--save] fluxbox

If you're using a client-side module bundler like [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) or [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/), you're done! Simply `require("fluxbox")` to get a reference to the library.

A standalone browser build of Fluxbox will be available soon.
