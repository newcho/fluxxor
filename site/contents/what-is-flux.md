What is Flux?
=============

Flux is an architecture for creating data layers in JavaScript applications. It was designed at Facebook along with the [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) view library.

Flux is an alternative to the "M" and "C" in the MVC architecture. In a client-side MVC application, a user interaction triggers code in a controller, which then coordinates changes to one or more models by calling methods on the model. When the models change, they notify one or more views, which in turn read the new data from the models and update themselves accordingly so that the user can see that new data.

As your application grows and you add nested views, controllers to go with them, and additional models, the dependencies become more complex.

With the addition of just three views, one controller, and one model, the dependency graph is already harder to trace. When the user interacts with the UI, there are multiple branching code paths, and debugging errors in application state becomes an exercise in figuring out which of these potential code paths contains a bug. In the worst cases, a user interaction will trigger updates which in turn trigger additional updates, resulting in error-prone and difficult-to-debug cascading effects along several of these paths.

Flux eschews this design in favor of a one-way data flow:

![Simple Flux](/images/flux-simple.png?1)

All user interactions within a view call an *action creator*, which causes an *action* event to be emitted from a singleton *dispatcher*. The dispatcher is a single-point-of-emission for all actions. The dispatcher also prevents cascading updates by ensuring that only one action can be dispatched at a time. The action is sent from the dispatcher to the *stores*, which update themselves in response to the action.

The flow doesn't change significantly for additional stores or views. The dispatcher simply sends every action to *all* the stores in the application. Note that it does not contain knowledge about how to actually update the storesâ€”the stores themselves contain this business logic. Each store is responsible for a domain of the application, and synchronously update themselves only in response to actions; they have no public properties or setter functions.

When a store updates, it emits a change event. In many React applications, special views (known sometimes as "controller-views") are responsible for watching for this change event, reading the stores' new data, and passing that data through properties to child views. It's not uncommon in a React application for a store change event to trigger a re-render of the top-level view, effectively re-rendering the entire view hierarchy (which React handles in an efficient manner). This completely avoids complex bugs and performance problems that can arise out of trying to watch for specific property changes on models and modifying parts of views only slightly.

Since stores have no setter methods or public properties for managing their data and change *only* in response to actions, testing them becomes simply a matter of putting them in a starting state, sending them an action, and testing that they end up in the expected final state. And since action dispatches and the action handlers in the stores are fully synchronous, debugging errors in application state simply involves figuring out which action caused the bad state change and then finding the bad logic that responded to that action.
