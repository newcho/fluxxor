Documentation
=============

Fluxbox consists of three core pieces:

* [Fluxbox.Flux](/documentation/flux.html)
* [Stores](/documentation/stores.html)
* [Actions](/documentation/actions.html)

Additionally, Fluxbox ships with some mixins to make it easier to use in conjunction with React:</p>

* [Fluxbox.FluxMixin](/documentation/flux-mixin.html)
* [Fluxbox.StoreWatchMixin](/documentation/store-watch-mixin.html)

For installation instructions, see the [Installation](/getting-started/installation.html) page. Be sure to check out the [quick-start guide](/getting-started/quick-start.html) and the [examples](/examples/), too!
