React Router Example
====================

This app shows how to use [React Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router) with Fluxxor. The Fluxxor website describes the technique used in more detail in [the Routing guide](http://fluxxor.com/guides/react-router.html).

To run, simply open `app/index.html` in your web browserâ€”`index.html` and `bundle.js` are the only files required to run the application (`bundle.js` is build with [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)). If you want to modify the source and see your updates, run `./start.sh` and point your browser to `http://localhost:8089/index.html` (you will need to install the `devDependencies` from the root of the Fluxxor project first).
